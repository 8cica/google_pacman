Google Pacman
-------------

This is a copy of Google's playable Pacman game logo hosted for
Pacman's 30th Anniversary.

With the help of StackOverflow users, we were able to get a playable
version working 100%.

To play a live version: http://macek.github.com/google_pacman/

Or download the source and run it offline.
