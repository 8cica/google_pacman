Google Pacman
-------------

This is a localized copy of Google's playable Pacman game logo hosted for
Pacman's 30th Anniversary.

With the help of StackOverflow users, we were able to get a playable
version working.

Wishlist
--------
1. Get sound working
2. Strip out unnecessary Google code


Any help is greatly appreciated.


Thanks to:

Skizo for noticing that relative paths don't work as expected when
executed locally.
